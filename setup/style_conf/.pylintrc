[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s).
# You can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this option multiple times
# (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where it should appear only once).
# You can also use "--disable=all" to disable everything first and then reenable specific checks.
# For example, if you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all --enable=similarities".
# If you want to run only the classes checker, but have no Warning level messages displayed,
# use "--disable=all --enable=classes --disable=W".
